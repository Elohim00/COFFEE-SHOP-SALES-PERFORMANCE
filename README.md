The bar chart breaks down sales by coffee type, offering insights into customer preferences:

- Latte: The most popular choice, generating the highest revenue.
- Americano: A close second in popularity.
- Cappuccino: The third most preferred option.
- Mocha: Holding the fourth position in sales.
- Hot Chocolate: While not technically coffee, it's a popular alternative.
- Cortado: Less popular but still contributing to sales.

This information can help the shop manage inventory, focus marketing efforts, and potentially adjust the menu to cater to customer preferences.

#### Payment Method Preferences

The pie chart shows a clear preference among customers for card payments:
- Card payments: $34,322.9 (91.5% of total sales)
- Cash payments: $3,186.0 (8.5% of total sales)

This overwhelming preference for card payments suggests that the shop should ensure its card payment systems are always functioning smoothly. It might also consider implementing or promoting contactless payment options to further convenience customers.

#### Filtering Options

These filters can help the shop analyze performance during specific time periods or parts of the day, allowing for more targeted strategies in staffing, promotions, or inventory management.

#### Summary

- Strong total sales revenue and a healthy average transaction value.
- A steady flow of unique customers, indicating a loyal customer base.

#### Analysis and Recommendations

##### Customer Retention:
With 447 unique customers and 1,133 transactions, each customer visits approximately 2.5 times per year on average. To increase the frequency of visits, the business should consider implementing a loyalty program. This program could offer rewards for frequent visits, such as discounts, free items after a certain number of purchases, or special promotions.

##### Product Focus:

- The business should focus on promoting high-margin items in popular categories, such as Lattes, Americanos, and Cappuccinos. These items are already well-liked by customers, and highlighting them further can boost profits.
- To increase sales of less popular drinks like Mochas, the business could bundle them with food items. For example, offering a Mocha with a pastry at a special price could attract more customers to try these drinks.

##### Operational Efficiency
- To enhance operational efficiency, it is important to optimize staffing based on daily sales patterns. Additionally, ensuring fast and reliable card payment processing is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction.

##### Marketing Strategies
Creating promotions to boost sales during identified slow periods can be effective. Using social media to highlight popular drinks and introduce new variations is also recommended.

##### Menu Engineering
Top-selling items should be placed prominently on the menu. It is essential to analyze the profitability of each drink type and adjust pricing if needed.

##### Seasonal Preparation
-Anticipating and preparing for high-sales periods, particularly in late July, is important. Developing strategies to mitigate sales dips, such as those observed in early July, will help maintain steady sales throughout the year.

#### Future Work

Future analysis could focus on:

- Exploring the impact of specific marketing campaigns and seasonal trends on sales.
- Conducting a deeper analysis of customer feedback to identify areas for improvement.
- Implementing predictive analytics to forecast future sales and demand patterns.
